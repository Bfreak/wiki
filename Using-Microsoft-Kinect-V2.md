# Introduction
[Microsoft Kinect V2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect) can be used in multiple ways as an Open Track Input device. Regardless which Kinect Input solution you will use, you must first and foremost make sure your Kinect is installed properly.

# Installation
We recommend you mount your Kinect above your screen where it should be at head level. At any time during use your head should remain at least 50 cm away from the Kinect sensor. To make sure this is the case your rest position should be around 70cm away from Kinect.
For mounting you can use a tripod with flexible feet to place directly on top of your monitor or have it grab on your monitor arm.
