I've built the latest unstable version, without the wine 32bit support, for Debian testing. It is without dependences, install any missing libraries manually ([Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15HhIHfoJ6WcMU1nhQ93dDLvj_SIr3SEa?usp=sharing)). 

This package is without dependencies but you must install libopencv-video406 and libqt5serialport5 packages (or similar) for your distro to enable different useful output plugins in Opentrack.
