# Introduction
We are glad you are enjoying openstack and want to contribute. Here is something to get you started ASAP.

# Development platform
Most of the development is happening on Microsoft Windows using Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.
Though I guess you could develop on Linux or OSX this guide will be assuming Windows as it is surely the easiest and fastest way to get started with openstack.

# Supported platform
Microsoft Windows 7 to 10, Linux. Apple's OSX as not been properly tested in a while.

# Supported architecture
Though official releases are still 32-bit only, 64-bit builds are working great too.

# Programming language
Most of openstack is implemented using C++17.

#  Build prerequisite
* Microsoft Windows 7 to 10.
