**Smartphone requirements:**
- gyroscope
- wifi, bluetooth(not tested but should work as well using teethering option) or USB network connection

**1.**
You need to connect PC and android smartphone to the same network (it could be wifi, usb or bluetooth)

**2. Install Opentrack 2.3 on your PC**

You need to set up mapping in opentrack for yaw, pitch and roll to be like on images below.

You need to invert two axes (this option can depend on your game)

Next you need to set up filter. I prefer to use Accela filter. 
You need also set up the 'center' key in keys tab to center the view in several situations.

As 'protocol' please choose Freetrack 2.0(compatible with most games)

Please select 'FreePie tracker' and set there 5555 port. Remember to open this UDP port for in your firewall.

Freepie Client is located in _your_OpenTrack_installation_directory\clientfiles\android-freepie_

Application name: com.freepie.android.imu-20141024.apk
Remember to enable "allow installation from unknown sources" on your smartphone before install.(You will be prompted with option to go to the settings if you haven't enabled this)

And configure it as you see on image below:
