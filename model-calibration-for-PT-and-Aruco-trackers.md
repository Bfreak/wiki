### How to get best calibration results

This is my method of calibrating and it works every time.

At start, move your head up as if pitching up

- *start*
- Make left-right yaw motion
- Move head slightly lower
- If moved to the limit of where you want to pitch down, click "toggle calibration", we're done
- Otherwise, repeat from *start*
