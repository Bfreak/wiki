This work for the Cap model, it may work for Clip and Custom as well.

When the squid flips upside down and the center cross is way off, the camera has lost sight of one or more of the tracking points.

To get back on track, turn your head to front and cover one of the LEDâ€™s, for a while, then uncover it again. This can be done with a finger or two.

You need to cover the LED a little longer, than the time set in the Dynamic pose timeout field. This is found in the PointTracker Settings Camera tab.

You can also press the Center key **twice**. The first press will reset dynamic pose, the second one will make it arrive at the right pose. It's a bug that it needs pressing twice. -sthalik
