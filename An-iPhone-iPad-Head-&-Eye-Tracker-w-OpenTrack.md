Livestream your online arena and MOBA gaming content with our accurate eye tracking overlay on Twitch, Youtube, or Facebook to share wherever you are looking at with your audience in real-time.

The free in beta Eyeware Beam app turns your iPhone or iPad, that supports Face ID with its built-in TrueDepth camera, into a reliable and precise, multi-purpose head and eye-tracking tool. Our app works as the input source, enabling a full range of in-game head motion. Use Eyeware Beam to add depth to your gaming and streaming experience with responsive, intuitive head movement controls.

There is no expensive headset, glasses, or additional hardware needed.

The TrueDepth technology produces a depth map of your face by projecting 30,000 infrared points that are recorded and processed by the smartphone chip’s neural engine. Eyeware Beam takes advantage of this technology to provide you with an app that generates an accurate head pose and eye tracking signal comparable to expensive proprietary devices from Tobii or TrackIR.
