Finally I've successfully built a headtrack with a MPU9250 using the hatire plugin. I need to say thanks to @hideakitai for [his library](https://github.com/hideakitai).

I've recorded some videos:

1. Basic usage, my devices was between the tablet and the monitor (EM interferences?), no issue on my head: here

2. A test with win10 and Falcon BMS 4.34.3: here

3. a test with Debian testing and FlightGear 2019.1.1: here


If you want to built it, see [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15HhIHfoJ6WcMU1nhQ93dDLvj_SIr3SEa?usp=sharing).
