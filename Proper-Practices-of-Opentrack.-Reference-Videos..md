After experimenting with opentrack as an early adopter I believe I achieved some perfect results with the latest releases where I would like to share with the community to provide some reference of a properly working opentrack.

Here I will share self captured footages from popular games. (currently one right now)

[Footage from War thunder](https://www.youtube.com/my_videos?o=U)

Setup:
* Pointracker and 3 point DIY hat clip with visible white wide angled LED's
* Playstation Eye Camera

Thanks to accela-filter. The tracking is extremely precise and stable.
