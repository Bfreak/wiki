# There are no Linux binaries!

It's assumed Linux users are software developers, support for the
platform's provided for their convenience only.

You can provide your own unofficial binaries.

# Linux 'install' build target doesn't respect hier(7)!

This is on purpose. The project won't include that platform-specific
file system layout.

# No binaries for OSX!

No developer resources. Take care of QA yourself if OSX binaries are to
be released again in the future.

# How to contribute a tracker/protocol?
